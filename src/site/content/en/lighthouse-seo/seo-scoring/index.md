  Learn how Lighthouse calculates the SEO score.
---

Lighthouse returns an SEO score between 0 and 100.	 
0 is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best.	 

Each SEO audit is equally weighted,	  
with the exception of the [structured-data audit](/structured-data),
a manual audit not included in the scoring.
To calculate how much each audit contributes
to your overall SEO score,	
count the number of SEO audits,	
then divide 100 by that number.

There's currently 10 weighted SEO audits,
each audit worth 10 points.
Fail one audit,
and your overall SEO score is 90.
